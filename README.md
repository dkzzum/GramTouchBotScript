# Script for the bot @gramTouchBot
It works completely randomly, which reduces the probability of detection by admins to a minimum.

### Configuration ⚙️
1. Get api id and api hash from [here](https://my.telegram.org/auth "here")
2. The received id and hash must be entered when running the script
3. You will also have to enter the presence of mining and auto-withdrawal (you just need to enter 0 or 1, where 0 is no, 1 is yes)

### Library Installation and Python version 📚
`pip install telethon`

### Python Version 🐍
Preferably Python 3.10+

### ‼️ The script is not updated (since the end of July)
